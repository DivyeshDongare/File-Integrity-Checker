# 🛡️ File Integrity Checker

## Project Goal: Your Digital Watchdog 🕵️‍♂️

Ever worried about unauthorized changes to your important files? This project aims to be your digital watchdog, ensuring the integrity of your data by building a system that can:

* **Calculate the hash of files** (e.g., using SHA-256) – Think of it as generating a unique digital fingerprint for each file.
* **Save these hash values securely** – We need a safe place to store these fingerprints for future reference.
* **Detect any unauthorized changes** by comparing hashes later – If a file's fingerprint changes, we'll know something's amiss!

## 🛠️ Libraries and Tools You Might Use

This project offers a fantastic opportunity to explore various Python libraries. Here are some you might find helpful:

### Core Python Libraries: The Essentials!

* **Hashing**: `hashlib` (Your go-to for generating those unique file fingerprints!)
* **File paths**: `os`, `pathlib` (Navigating your file system like a pro.)
* **Directory traversal**: `os`, `glob`, `pathlib` (For scanning entire folders efficiently.)
* **File storage**: `json`, `sqlite3`, `csv`, or plain text (How will you store those precious hash values? SQLite is a strong contender for structured data!)
* **Logging**: `logging` (Keep track of what your system is doing, especially when things go wrong!)
* **Scheduling (optional)**: `schedule`, `threading`, `time` (Want to automate checks? These are your friends!)

### For CLI Tools (Optional Enhancements - Level Up Your Experience! 🚀):

If you're building a command-line interface, consider these for a slick user experience:

* **CLI parsing**: `argparse`, `click`, `typer` (Make your commands easy to use!)
* **Colored output**: `colorama`, `rich` (Who doesn't love a bit of color in their terminal?)

### 🖼️ For GUI (if you choose to add one - Make it User-Friendly!):

Thinking of a graphical interface? Here are some options:

* **GUI framework**: `tkinter`, `PyQt5`, or `Kivy` (Pick your poison for desktop applications!)
* **File dialogs**: `tkinter.filedialog` (For easy file and folder selection.)

## 📂 Project File Structure (Suggested - Your Roadmap to Success! 🗺️)

Here's a logical way to organize your project, encouraging modularity and clean code:

```bash
file_integrity_checker/
├── scanner.py        # Scans directories and files
├── hasher.py         # Handles hash generation
├── database.py       # Manages storing and retrieving file hashes (e.g., SQLite operations)
├── checker.py        # Compares current hashes with stored ones to detect changes
├── logger.py         # Centralized logging setup
├── config.json       # Stores user-definable settings (e.g., directories to monitor, hash algorithm)
├── cli.py            # Command-line interface logic (if implemented)
├── gui.py            # GUI frontend logic (if implemented)
├── main.py           # The main entry point for your application
└── logs/             # Directory to store log files

# Testing Tips

* Use dummy folders with known files.
* Try editing a file after storing the hash and check if detection works.
* Test performance on large files and directories.
